# The Fridge Manager Challenge

To practice building MCP Servers, challenge yourself to build a fridge manager!

## The Setup

In this folder you'll find the `fridge/` folder containing:
- `fridge_contents.csv` - Structured data describing regular items found in a fridge
- `fridge_utils.py` - Python script with functions for retrieving and managing the contents of the fridge.

# The Challenge

Using the setup instructions found in `simple-server` as a starting point, create a new MCP server in a new `fridge_manager_server` folder.

Then hand-code or use your preferred AI coding assistant to build out resources, tools, and prompts that leverage the existing Python functions in `fridge/fridge_utils.py` to manage the fridge contents.

Remember: Everything you need to complete this challenge and build your own MCP server is in this repo. Follow the instructions, take inspiration from the other MCP server examples, and make the Fridge Manager MCP your own!

Lykke til!
